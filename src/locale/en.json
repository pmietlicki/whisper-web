This means that your audio file never leaves your device. It also means that the transcription will be slow or fail if your computer/smartphone is not powerful enough to perform it.<1></1><1></1>In the settings (bottom right corner), you can pick among different models and various quantisation levels. A smaller model with a lower quantisation will be faster but make more mistakes. By default, Whisper-web uses small models but you can try a bigger one and see if it works on your device.<1></1><1></1>For most languages, it is best to use <4>OpenAI's official models</4> (Multilingual) but for Swedish or Norwegian, it is recommended to use versions that have been specifically trained for them.<1></1><1></1>The Swedish models are called <8>KB-whisper</8> and have been trained by the <12>national library</12> on data from parliament debates and the Swedish public service. The Norwegian ones are named <16>nb-whisper</16> and have also been trained by the country's <20>national library</20>.<1></1><1></1>This project's source code is available on <23>Github</23>.
